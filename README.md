# Machine-Learning-Unsupervised-Learning
1) Unsupervised learning with K-means clustering algorithm in order to compress an image by reducing no. of colors that are in
image to only those that are most common in image.
2) Use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to preform dimensionality reduction on face image dataset.
Please see ex7.pdf for project details.
